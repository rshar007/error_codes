# Chapter 1: Information and Coding Theory

## Introduction
Information theory has its roots in Claude Shannon's classic paper,
`A Mathematical Theory of Communication.' In that paper, we learn of
the relationship between information, its source, and the medium we
use to transmit that information. There are three main concepts his
theory:
(i) a quantity for the measurement of information,
(ii) the relationship between information and its source, and
(iii) the relationship between information and the unreliable
channel that it is transmitted over.
